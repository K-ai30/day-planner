Work Day Planner
Third-Party APIs: Day Planner

This project was create to conceptualize and code a simple calendar application, which users would find engaging, but straightforward to use.  This application makes use of a working understanding and knowledge about how to use JQuery, Third-Party APIs, and Moment.js to create an application where end users can schedule their day and keep track in real-time of their activities, while the scheduler saves fields of input to localStorage for later retrieval.  Moment.js consists of a library to work with date and time functions to streamline this functionality.  Each day tracks the standard business hours (9 A.M. - 5 P.M.).  The challenges with this project were to develop coding that would result in each "Task" field changing colors appropriately, as follows:

Grey - Past
Red - Current
Green - Future

This functionality would allow for better time management.
